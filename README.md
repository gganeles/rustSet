# rustSet - Multiplayer Card Games

A real-time multiplayer gaming platform featuring the card game **Set** and **Anagrams**, built with a Rust WebSocket server and SolidJS frontend.

## 🎮 Games

### Set
The classic pattern-recognition card game where players race to identify sets of three cards that are all the same or all different across four attributes: color, shape, number, and shading.

### Anagrams
A word game where players compete to form words from a shared pool of letters, with the ability to steal words by adding letters to form new valid words.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend (Rust)
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time communication using `tokio`, `warp`, and `tokio-tungstenite`
- **Game Engine**: Trait-based game system supporting multiple game types
- **Python Integration**: Uses PyO3 to integrate with spaCy for NLP features in Anagrams
- **Features**:
  - Room-based multiplayer games
  - Real-time game state synchronization
  - Chat system with game notifications
  - Player management and scoring

### Frontend (SolidJS)
- **Framework**: SolidJS with Vite for fast, reactive UI
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS for responsive design
- **Features**:
  - Real-time game updates via WebSockets
  - Lobby system for creating and joining games
  - Interactive game boards
  - Player name customization
  - Image preloading for smooth gameplay

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Rust** (latest stable version)
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **Python 3** (for Anagrams NLP features)

### Running the Server

#### Option 1: Local Development (Recommended)

```bash
cd server

# For fish shell users:
./setup_python.fish

# For bash/zsh users:
./setup_python.sh

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate.fish  # fish
# or
source venv/bin/activate        # bash/zsh

# Run the server
cargo run
```

The server will start on `ws://127.0.0.1:3030/ws`

#### Option 2: Docker

```bash
# From repository root
docker-compose up --build
```

See [server/README.md](server/README.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Running the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Start the server** (see above)
2. **Start the frontend** (see above)
3. **Open your browser** to http://localhost:5173
4. **Enter your name** when prompted
5. **Create a new game** or **join an existing game** from the lobby
6. **Play!** Click cards to select them and compete with other players in real-time
